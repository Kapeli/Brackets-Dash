Brackets-Dash
===

A simple Dash integration plugin for Brackets. Requires [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) and OSX to work. It is driven by the current selection and hard-coded to use CTRL+ALT+H for the key combo. I may add support for sniffing the current file type so it can better filter the results.
